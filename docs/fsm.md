# SAP Field Service Management

ShellSdk has been developed as part of the [SAP Field Service Management](https://www.sap.com/products/field-service-management.html) project to provide a front-end API to components allowing them acess and update to the surrounding interface.

!> This library does not intend to replace the public API used to access and manipulate data.  
More informations about fsm's public api on the [SAP Field Service Management Help Portal](https://docs.coresystems.net/)

ShellSdk is used internally, but also by third party developers as part of the extension feature.
